# World Population & Demographic Analysis – Power BI

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes global, regional, and country-level population trends using demographic and economic indicators from 1960 to 2023. All the data were downloaded and retrieved through APIs from the World Bank's data.org. The dashboards provide interactive insights into population growth, demographic transitions, socio-economic patterns, and the current state of each country's population trajectory.  

## 📊 Dashboards Included
### 1. World Population Dashboard

- KPIs(Total countries, Total population, Highest population, Lowest population, Year over Year Growth Percentage)
- Total population & country coverage
- Top 10 highest and lowest population countries
- Global population growth trend
- Gender-wise population distribution
- Highest growth rate countries
- Navigation Bar

### 2. Global Population & Socioeconomic Dashboard

- Population distribution by region
- KPIs(Total regions, Highest population region, Highest population among regions)
- Income group and demographic type analysis
- Regional growth trends over time
- Highest growth percentage

### 3. Country Demographic Dashboard

- Population growth & age group distribution over time
- GDP & GDP per capita trends
- Life expectancy & birth rate analysis
- Population density insights
- KPIs(Current population, Population growth, GDP, GDP per capita, Life expentency) 

## 🧱 Data Model
- Star-schema design
- Unpivoted fact tables for time-series optimization
- Dimension tables: Country, Region, Income Group, Year
- Centralized DAX measure tables

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Power BI
- DAX
- Power Query
- Data Modeling
- Data Visualization

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Global population growth is increasingly concentrated in specific regions rather than evenly distributed worldwide.
- The demographic transition stage is a stronger driver of population growth than geographic location alone.
- The current global workforce is at its peak, but aging trends indicate a shrinking labor force in many regions.
- Economic development has not kept pace with population concentration, increasing inequality between population size and economic output.
- Countries with weaker economic foundations are experiencing the fastest population growth, increasing development pressure.
- Regional population growth trajectories are diverging, reflecting differences in fertility rates, healthcare access, and economic development.
- At a global level, gender distribution is balanced, indicating that population challenges are driven more by age and growth patterns than gender imbalance.
- Even modest population growth can significantly increase pressure on land and urban infrastructure.
- Population trends cannot be understood in isolation; economic and demographic indicators together reveal deeper structural challenges
